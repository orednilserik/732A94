\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula denoted as 'Y ~ X' that formalizes the relationship to be linearly calculated.
The independent variables on the right side of the tilde sign can include multiple, separated by '+'.}

\item{data}{A data frame that contains the variables which are to be modelled.}
}
\value{
An RC-class object of the created linear model on which analyze can be made.
}
\description{
An object of RC-class that is used to create a linear model from given formula.
The formula should have variables that stems from a given dataset and formalized as 'Y ~ X'.
The created model can then be used to access varying functions for analyzing.
Functions available are: print, plot, resid, pred, coef, summary.
