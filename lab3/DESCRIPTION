Description: The package has 2 functions, one is an algorithm that calculates the greatest common divider(euclidan algorithm) for two scalars x and y.
	The other function does a dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between a start node and every other node in a given graph. 
	This function takes a data frame with 3 columns named 'v1','v2' and 'w' and a start node(init_node) and returns a vector with the distances.
